# Introduction

**Raster** data is a type of spatial data that is stored as a grid of squares or rectangles called pixels. Each pixel contains a value that represents a specific location on the Earth's surface [@terra24]. Terra package provides methods to manipulate spatial data in both **raster** and **vector** format [@terra24]. **Terra** package supports `SpatRaster` data -- that can  handle large raster files and `SpatVector` data -- that supports all types of geometric operations such as intersections in vector files. **Tidyterra** is a package that uses common methods from the tidyverse for `SpatRaster` and `SpatVector` objects created with the terra package [@tidyterra23]. 


First, we will load packages that we are going to use in this post:


```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| comment: ""
#| 
require(tidyterra)
require(terra)
require(leaflet)



```

# Data

We will use satellite chlorophyll-*a* data measured by the MODIS sensor in Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) with file extension *.nc* for Tanzania coastal waters. The data will be loaded using `rast()` function of **terra** package [@terra24].

```{r}
chl = rast("M2012214-2012244.vw.all_products.MYO.median.01aug12-31aug12.1368530332.data.nc")

chl
```

Our chl data is in SpatRaster with 2224 number of rows, 1112 number of columns and 3 number of layers. Layers include l2_flags, chl_oc3 and land_mask. The spatial resolution of our data is 0.004496807 pixels which is equivalent to `r 0.004496807*110` km approximately 0.5 km. We will select (using `select()` of **tidyterra** package) and plot (using `plot()` of **terra** package) the second layer (chl_oc3) which contain chlorophyll-*a* values.


```{r}
chl |> 
  select(chl_oc3) |> 
  filter(chl_oc3 < 1) |>
  terra::plot()
```

# Defining the extent

Suppose our analysis is focus only to a portion of Tanzania coastal area and not the whole area. So we need to crop that area on interest and leave the others. The focus of this post is around the Pemba Channel within longitude 38.9 and 40 East, and latitude -5.7, -4.6 South of the Equator. The first step is to specify the extent of our area using the `ext()` function of **terra** package [@terra24]:

```{r}
site.extent = ext( 38.9, 40, -5.7, -4.6)

```

# Cropping

Then, we will crop our extent area from chl data using the `crop()` function of **terra** package [@terra24].

```{r}
site.crop = chl |> 
  crop(site.extent)

```

# Plotting the cropped area

Lastly we will plot our cropped area and visualize them;

```{r}
site.crop |> 
  select(chl_oc3) |> 
  filter(chl_oc3 < 1) |> 
  terra::plot()

# site.crop |> writeCDF("pemba_crop.nc", overwrite = T)
```


We may also visualize the cropped area using **leaflet** package [@leaflet24];

```{r}

pal = colorNumeric(c("#7f007f", "#0000ff",  "#007fff", "#00ffff", "#00bf00", "#7fdf00", "#ffff00", "#ff7f00", "#ff3f00", "#ff0000", "#bf0000"),  na.color = "transparent", values(site.crop |> select(chl_oc3) |> filter(chl_oc3 < 1)))              

leaflet::leaflet() |> 
  leaflet::addTiles() |> 
  leaflet::addRasterImage(site.crop |> select(chl_oc3) |> filter(chl_oc3 < 1),
                          colors = pal,
                          opacity = 1) |> 
  leaflet::addLegend(pal = pal,
                     values = values(site.crop |> select(chl_oc3) |> filter(chl_oc3 < 1)),
                     title = "Chlorophyll")


```
